This is a set of programs to implement grep.
make sure the following files are present:
1. Resource.cpp -- Contains the classes for NFA and DFA
2. Recource.h
3. REGEX2NFA.cpp -- converts a REGEX to NFA and prints it
4. NFA2DFA.cpp -- converts NFA to DFA via subset construction (Make sure to press Ctrl-D after input)
5. MinDFA.cpp -- minimizes no. of states in DFA
6. acceptDFA.cpp -- accepts a DFA and a string and then prints YES iff DFA accepts string
7. grepcopy.cpp

To make all executables enter:
	make all
To make a specfic executable, say for part b:
	make cs15b061b
To remove all executables:
	make clean
